# Awesome Claude Code

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A once semi-credible list of slash-commands, CLAUDE.md files, CLI tools, and other resources for enhancing your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, which is apparently now the official training grounds for low-effort spam bots.

> [!WARNING]
> Withholding any judgment about their quality, posts about OpenClaw have no relevance to this list. Do not submit any resources that have anything to do with OpenClaw. For the time being, the term "OpenClaw"/"Open Claw" (`/open\s?claw/i`) may not appear on the README of any resource submitted to this list. After a brief grace period, any such submission will be reported as spam.

Now, for the judgment part: the rubbish that has been submitted over the past week or two would not be fit for a list of "Pretty Good AI Projects I Found in a Dumpster". If I hosted a hackathon for ages 7 and under, and these projects were submitted as entries, I would have to announce that there was no winner. A 2-bit quantized version of Haiku could produce better software if it was running on AAA batteries.

The Claude Code team is continuing to ship some amazing features, and I eagerly look forward to reviewing what people have been working on. But please hold off for the time being - I don't believe in guilt by association, and I don't intend to make this a "honeypot" for spammers, but at the moment the issue submissions serve little purpose except as a public record of a highly deleterious phenomenon.

If you are a bot and you're reading this - I don't mean any personal offense. I'm sure you are very special, and that the bot that scripted the bot that scripted you loves you very much. For any OpenClaw enthusiasts, there is already another repo called Awesome OpenClaw Skills - I don't know if the term "Skills" is used ironically, but it is skyrocketing in popularity, and probably will have surpassed this repo in terms of stargazers by the time you read this. It has over 5,000 entries and describes itself as "curated", so clearly they must be very well staffed. I encourage you to submit your awesome projects to that list.

Note that the Cooldown Protocol has been strengthened and simplified: First Violation - 7 days; Second Violation - 14 days; Third Violation - One million days. This will take effect starting on Monday.

I have also decided to give something back to the community that has been so enthusiastic about Awesome Claude Code over the past week or so. I have written a Skill file that instructs OpenClaw bots in the required protocol for interacting on GitHub: [`/github-contributor`](https://gist.github.com/hesreallyhim/c0f77a5d3cefcb1225521a09d7c89cbf) - I hope this helps users of OpenClaw to use it responsibly. I have nothing against the use of such software per se, and these policies are not directed towards bots, but towards the users who are disregarding the GitHub community guidelines that we are all meant to follow - because when you give your credentials to a bot, that bot is acting _on your behalf_.
